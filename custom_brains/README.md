### Base model
`smolvla_base` is a combination of a VLM and an "action expert". It is trained according to the [specs](https://huggingface.co/lerobot/smolvla_base/blob/main/train_config.json).

### Fine-tuning
The custom [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/olingoudey/so101puttingcubeinbowl) trains the fine tuned model (specs to come).
